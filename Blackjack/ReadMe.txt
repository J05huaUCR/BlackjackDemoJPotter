[Game Play]
Upon loading, the user must add themselves to the game and specify some string for their name. Once the player is added, select "New Game" from the game menu to start a new game (as long as there is not a game currently active). During gameplay, the player has the option of using either the Game menu or the Hit and Stand buttons for gameplay.

[Known Issues]
- There is an intermittent incorrect value where a card is assigned a value 1 larger than the correct value.
